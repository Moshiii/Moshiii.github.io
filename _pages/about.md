## Bio

Hello, I am Moshi, a Ph.D. student in Software Engineering from York University. My research focuses on addressing the usability and reliability issues of deep-learning APIs, such as recommending and detecting misuse of deep-learning APIs. During my Ph.D. study, I have published several papers on deep-learning API recommendation and misuse detection in top-tier software engineering conferences (ICSE, ASE) and journals. Besides my research experience, I also have experience working in industry companies such as Huawei Canada and Ericsson. I am currently looking for professorial positions in Canada to continue my research on API usability and reliability.

## Experience

### Ph.D. Candidate, York University\
Sep. 2020 – Now

* Extracted and formatted data from Stackoverflow and the official Java documentation using BS4, followed  by tokenization and EDA analysis using Scikit-learn, StanfordNLP, and NLTK, and visualisation using Seaborn and Pyplot.

* Created sourcecode pro-processing pipline with Python AST parser, APIs are extracted from a code snippet and tokenized with a custom tokenizer.

* Trained MLP models such as Seq2seq LSTM, BERT, CodeBERT, Pegasus, Text-CNN with Huggingface, Pytorch or Tensorflow with multiple loss functions for performance optimization such as contrastive learning, prototypical network, siamese network, and compared baseline models such as SVM, NB, KNN, and XGBoost build with sklearn based on multiple metrics such as MRR, MAP, precision, recall, and F1

### Ericsson – Software Engineer (Intern)\
Sep. 2021 – Jan. 2022

* Joined the research team as a research intern for prototyping a web-based low-code webpage editing platform with web components, AngularJS, and GrapeJS.

### Software Engineer – BI, Achievers\
May. 2019 – Sep. 2020

* Initiated and developed an awarded collaborative filtering-based user recommendation system with Spacy, Scikit-learn, and pandas. Run the system on 200 users for testing and feedback
* Developed and maintained daily ETL tasks with Centerprise ETL and PostgreSQL
* Speedup TB-level ETL data warehouse restoration time by 24 times by restructuring workflow using PostgreSQL and python
