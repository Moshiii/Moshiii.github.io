## Bio

Hello, I am Moshi, a Ph.D. student in Software Engineering from York University. My research focuses on addressing the usability and reliability issues of deep-learning APIs, such as recommending and detecting misuse of deep-learning APIs. During my Ph.D. study, I have published several papers on deep-learning API recommendation and misuse detection in top-tier software engineering conferences (ICSE, ASE) and journals. Besides my research experience, I also have experience working in industry companies such as Huawei Canada and Ericsson. I am currently looking for professorial positions in Canada to continue my research on API usability and reliability.

## Highlights

* Publications in top venues: 3 ICSE, 1 FSE, 1 ISSTA
* Research Interests: software engineering, machine learning, software reliability, software defect prediction, and software testing. Focusing on using deep learning, and language model techniques to improve system usability and reliability.
