## problems
A significant SE problem in the software that uses DNNs is the presence of bugs. What are the common bugs in such software?

## steps
we conduct a comprehensive study of bug repair patterns for five DNN libraries Caffe, Keras, Tensorflow,
Theano, and Torch.

We leverage the dataset of DNN bugs published by Islam et al. [10] that consists of 415 bugs from Stack Overflow and 555 bugs from Github
