## takeaway
Our key findings reveal that DNN bug fix patterns are distinctive compared to traditional bug fix patterns;
the most common bug fix patterns are fixing data dimension and neural network connectivity;

We also contribute a benchmark of 667 DNN (bug, repair) instances.

major challenges:
* DNN bug fixes have the potential to introduce adversarial vulnerabilities; 
* DNN bug fixes frequently introduce new bugs; 
* DNN bug localization, reuse of trained model
* coping with frequent releases
