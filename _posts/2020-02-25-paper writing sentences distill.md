X apps belong to the most A-B and C-D app category.

Qs often misconceive that A Bs provide Xs and an Y, by assuming all Zs are done between A Bs and C Ds Ely (e.g., over HTTPS). 

Unfortunately, this assumption does not always hold.

To understand the Xs exhibited in A Bs and help to improve the C of these Ds, several studies have
been done manually on a E-F A Bs [30, 61, 63, 64].
